# HugeInteger Class
Create a class HugeInteger that uses a 40-element array of digits to store integers as large as 40 digits each.
Provide member functions input, output, add and subtract.
For comparing HugeInteger objects, provide functions isEqualTo, isNotEqualTo, isGreaterThan, isLessThan, isGreaterThanOrEqualTo and isLessThanOrEqualTo ¡ª each of these is a ¡°predicate¡± function that simply returns true if the relationship holds between the two HugeIntegers and returns false if the relationship does not hold.
Also, provide a predicate function isZero.
If you feel ambitious, provide member functions multiply, divide and modulus.
